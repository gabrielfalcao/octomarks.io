# Yipit Merchants

Steps

## 1. A replacement for the current google form

Just put the business name and the location, just like yelp.  We could
get the business from our database first, and then try to get from
yelp if nothing was found in our db.

## 2. Claim the profile

The business already choose his name from our list in the step before.

Get a form with ("if it's a restaurant, we might want to talk to the owner" Sean)

If the user is not already logged in yipit, we want to get him through
signup flow (simplified)

First name, Last name, email, password

## 3. show them the dashboard

She will then be rewarded with a dashboard.

## 4. Send her an email with all the features

A bullet list with all the cool features she can enjoy from yipit
